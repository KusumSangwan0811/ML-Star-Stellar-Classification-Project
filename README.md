# ML-Star-Stellar-Classification-Project
In this project, the aim is to classify stars based on various features in the Star Stellar Class dataset which consists of 100000 observations and 18 features. I trained different ML models and we compared the performance of models are evaluated on a test data. Also, done hyperparameter tuning to further improve the performance.
