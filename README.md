# Star Stellar Classification ML Project
In this project, the aim is to classify stars based on various features in the Star Stellar Class dataset which consists of 100000 observations and 18 features. I trained different ML models and we compared the performance of models are evaluated on a test data. Also, done hyperparameter tuning to further improve the performance.

## Overview

In astronomy, stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics. The classification scheme of galaxies, quasars, and stars is one of the most fundamental in astronomy. The early cataloguing of stars and their distribution in the sky has led to the understanding that they make up our own galaxy and, following the distinction that Andromeda was a separate galaxy to our own, numerous galaxies began to be surveyed as more powerful telescopes were built. Using this datasat, the aim is to classify stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral characteristics.

### Star Stellar Classification Dataset: 

The dataset is downloaded from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17?resource=download&select=star_classification.csv). The data consists of 100,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.


## Sturucture of project:

In this project, I predict the class of star with various ML algorithms such as SVM Classifier, Navie Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and XGboost Classifier. The following steps are taken in this work:

1. Downloading this dataset from Kaggle
2. Understanding the dataset, formulating the problem and describing the objective
3. Performing a exploratory data analysis, gathering insights, creating a training, & test split and finally preparing the data for modeling.
4. Training & evaluating the different machine learning models.
5. Comparing their performances.
6. Reporting the final performance of best model and showing sample predictions.
7. Hyperparameter tuning on best performing model to further improve accuracy.

At last, summary of the work and links to references.
